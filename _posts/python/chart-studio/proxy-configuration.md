<!-- #region -->
If you are behind a corporate firewall, you may see the error message:
```
requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: ('Connection aborted.', TimeoutError(10060, ...)
```
Plotly uses the requests module to communicate with the Plotly server. You can configure proxies by setting the environment variables HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY.
```
$ export HTTP_PROXY="http://10.10.1.10:3128"
$ export HTTPS_PROXY="http://10.10.1.10:1080"
```
To use HTTP Basic Auth with your proxy, use the http://user:password@host/ syntax:

```
$ export HTTP_PROXY="http://user:pass@10.10.1.10:3128/"
```

Note that proxy URLs must include the scheme.

You may also see this error if your proxy variable is set but you are no longer behind the corporate proxy. Check if a proxy variable is set with:

```
$ echo $HTTP_PROXY
$ echo $HTTPS_PROXY
```
