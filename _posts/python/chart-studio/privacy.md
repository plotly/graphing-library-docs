#### Default Privacy
By default, `plotly.iplot()` and `plotly.plot()` create public graphs (which are free to create). With a [plotly subscription](https://plotly.com/plans) you can easily make charts private or secret via the sharing argument.


#### Public Graphs

```python
import chart_studio.plotly as py
import plotly.graph_objects as go

data = [
    go.Scatter(
        x=[1, 2, 3],
        y=[1, 3, 1]
    )
]

py.iplot(data, filename='privacy-public', sharing='public')
```

Below is the URL of this public plot.  Anyone can view public plots even if they are not logged into Plotly.  Go ahead and try it out:

```python
py.plot(data, filename='privacy-public', sharing='public')
```

### Private Graphs

```python
py.iplot(data, filename='privacy-private', sharing='private')
```

Below is the URL of the private plot above. Only the owner can view the private plot. You won't be able to view this plot, try it out:

```python
py.plot(data, filename='privacy-private', sharing='private')
```

### Secret Graphs

```python
py.iplot(data, filename='privacy-secret', sharing='secret')
```

Below is the URL of this secret plot. Anyone with the secret link can view this chart. However, it will not appear in the Plotly feed, your profile, or search engines. Go ahead and try it out:

```python
py.plot(data, filename='privacy-secret', sharing='secret')
```

### Make All Future Plots Private
To make all future plots private, you can update your configuration file to create private plots by default:

```python
import chart_studio
chart_studio.tools.set_config_file(world_readable=False, sharing='private')
```

### Make All Existing Plots Private
This example uses [Plotly's REST API](https://api.plot.ly/v2/)

```python
import json
import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
```

Define variables, including YOUR [USERNAME and API KEY](https://plotly.com/settings/api)

```python
username = 'private_plotly' # Replace with YOUR USERNAME
api_key = 'k0yy0ztssk' # Replace with YOUR API KEY

auth = HTTPBasicAuth(username, api_key)
headers = {'Plotly-Client-Platform': 'python'}

page_size = 500
```

Collect filenames of <b>ALL</b> of your plots and <br>update `world_readable` of each plot with a PATCH request

```python
def get_pages(username, page_size):
    url = 'https://api.plot.ly/v2/folders/all?user='+username+'&filetype=plot&page_size='+str(page_size)
    response = requests.get(url, auth=auth, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code != 200:
        return
    page = json.loads(response.content.decode('utf-8'))
    yield page
    while True:
        resource = page['children']['next']
        if not resource:
            break
        response = requests.get(resource, auth=auth, headers=headers)
        if response.status_code != 200:
            break
        page = json.loads(response.content.decode('utf-8'))
        yield page

def make_all_plots_private(username, page_size=500):
    for page in get_pages(username, page_size):
        for x in range(0, len(page['children']['results'])):
            fid = page['children']['results'][x]['fid']
            requests.patch('https://api.plot.ly/v2/files/'+fid, {"world_readable": False}, auth=auth, headers=headers)
    print('ALL of your plots are now private - visit: https://plotly.com/organize/home to view your private plots!')

make_all_plots_private(username)
```
