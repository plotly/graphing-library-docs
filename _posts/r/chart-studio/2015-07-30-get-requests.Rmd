### Download Chart Studio Graphs Into R Sessions

Download Chart Studio figures directly into your R session with the `api_download_plot()` function. This takes the `plot_id` of the Chart Studio plot and the `username` of the plot's creator as arguments.

For example, to download [https://plotly.com/~cpsievert/559](https://plotly.com/~cpsievert/559) into R, call:

```{r}
library(plotly)
fig <- api_download_plot("559", "cpsievert")
fig
```

### Update The Layout on A Downloaded Graph

Once the figure is downloaded from Chart Studio into your R session, you can update its layout just like you would any other figure you create with the `plotly` R package. 

**Note:** If you were to re-upload this figure to Chart Studio, a new figure would be created unless you specify the same `filename` as the figure that you downloaded. In that case, the existing figure will be overwritten.

```{r}
p <- layout(fig, title = paste("Modified on ", Sys.time()))
p
```

### Adding a Trace to a Subplot Figure

```{r}
fig <- api_download_plot("6343", "chelsea_lyn")

p <- add_lines(fig, x = c(1, 2), y = c(1, 2), xaxis = "x2", yaxis = "y2")
p
```
