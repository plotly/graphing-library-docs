# Contribute to Plotly's [R Documentation](https://plotly.com/r/)

These are the instructions for contributing to the subset of the documentation for Plotly's R graphing library which deals with Chart Studio. 

In order to contribute to the majority of Plotly's R graphing library documentation (which is not related to Chart Studio), please visit the [plotly.r-docs](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.r-docs) repository. 

## Initial Steps:
1. Clone the repo:

  ```
  $ git clone git@github.com:plotly/graphing-library-docs.git
  $ cd graphing-library-docs
  ```

2. Check Ruby version `$ ruby --version`. We recommend using the same ruby version as gh-pages: https://pages.github.com/versions/. Note [RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) is helpful for installing and managing ruby versions.

3. Install bundler and a couple dependencies from the gemfile:

  ```
  $ gem install bundler
  $ bundle install

  ```
<b>IMPORTANT</b> -If not using bundler and the gemfile, [install the same jekyll version that GitHub Pages is using](https://pages.github.com/versions/).

## Create R Documentation:

##### In `documentation/_posts/r`
1. Write your tutorial in R Markdown (Rmd) file (**IMPORTANT:** do not edit the markdown (md) files by hand! All edits should happen in the .Rmd file! The *only* exception to this is the index file: `2015-07-30-r-index.md` which you should edit directly.)
  - Your .Rmd file should be named in the following format: `yyyy-mm-dd-chart-type.Rmd`
  - Please base your tutorial off of one of our exsisting tutorials (i.e. `documentation/_posts/r/2015-11-19-shapes.Rmd`)
      - Include the following header (*replacing `your-tutorial-chart` with the type of chart you're creating in the tutorial.) :
      ```
      ---
      name: Your-Tutorial-Chart
      permalink: r/your-tutorial-chart/
      description: How to create your-tutorial-chart in R. Short description of your tutorial.
      layout: base
      thumbnail: thumbnail/your-tutorial-chart.jpg *see step 2 for further thumbnail instructions*
      language: r
      page_type: example_index
      display_as: chart_type
      order: 3 *see below for order instructions*
      output:
        html_document:
          keep_md: true
      ---
      ```
      *`order` defines the order in which the tutorials appear on plot.ly/r. Please take a look at https://plotly.com/r/ and order your tutorial next to similar chart types.
      - Under the header, include the following r code snippet:

      ```
        ```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
        knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning=FALSE)
      ```

      - If your example needs to authenticate with Chart Studio, use the following R code snippet instead: 

      ```
        ```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
        knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning=FALSE)
        Sys.setenv("plotly_username"="RPlotBot")
        Sys.setenv("plotly_api_key"="q0lz6r5efr")```
      ```

      - To include R code and plots in your tutorial, format the code snippets and plots in the following format:

      ```
        ```{r}
        library(plotly)
        #Add your R Code Here i.e.:
        p <- plot_ly(economics, x = ~date, y = ~uempmed, name = "unemployment")
        p```
      ```

    ```

2. Convert the `.Rmd` file to a `.md` file.
  - Single `.Rmd` file: `Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('YOUR_FILE_.RMD', output_dir='OUTPUT_DIRECTORY')"` in your terminal.

  -Convert all the `.Rmd` files in a given directory:  `for i in R_FILE_PATH/*.Rmd; do Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('$i', output_dir='OUTPUT_DIRECTORY')"; done` in your terminal.

3. Add Thumbnail Images
  - Thumbnail images should named `your-tutorial-chart.jpg` and be *EXACTLY* 160px X 160px
  - Thumbnail images should be clear and interesting. You do not need to capture the ENTIRE chart, but rather focus on the most interesting part of the chart.
  - Use images.plot.ly for adding new images.
    - Log-in here: https://661924842005.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
    - Username: Plotly_Editors
    - From the <b>Amazon Web Services Console</b> select <b>S3 (Scalable Storage in the Cloud)</b> then select <b>plotly-tutorials</b> -> <b>plotly-documentation</b> -> <b>thumbnail</b>
    - Now from <b>All Buckets /plotly-tutorials/plotly-documentation/thumbnail</b> select the <b>Actions</b> dropdown and <b>upload</b> your .jpg file

##### In the terminal in `documentation`
4. Make a PR

  - Ready for your changes to be reviewed? Make a pull request against the `master` branch!
  Create a feature branch and use `git status` to list changed files.
  ```
  git checkout -b your_feature_branch
  git status
  ```
  - Add, commit, and push the files that you'd like to add to your PR:
  ```
  git add file-a
  git add file-b
  git commit -m 'message about your changes'
  git push origin your_feature_branch
  ```
  - Visit the [graphing-library-docs](https://github.com/plotly/graphing-library-docs) repository and open a pull request against the `master` branch. You can then tag **@jdamiba** for a review.

5. To proof your work follow these steps: https://github.com/plotly/graphing-library-docs/blob/master/Contributing.md#rendering-the-pages-locally

##### At https://plotly.com/r
6. Your changes haven't been deployed yet so they won't be online. That said, <b>PLEASE</b> visit https://plotly.com/r/your-tutorial and make sure everything looks correct once they have been deployed.

  - Some common problems that you should check for:
    - Make sure all plots appear!
    - The thumbnail image appears on: https://plotly.com/r/

## Search

We now have search via algolia implemented on our index and reference documentation pages! Please refer to our [make README](https://github.com/plotly/graphing-library-docs/blob/master/make_instructions.txt) for more information on how search works and instructions on how to update or edit Plotly search indices.

Thanks for contributing to our documentation!!
